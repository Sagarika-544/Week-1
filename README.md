# 🌿 AI-Based Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Using Machine Learning

---

## 🧠 Project Description
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in urban regions.  
By analyzing historical air pollution and weather data, the model forecasts future AQI levels to assist in early warning systems and sustainable urban planning.

The goal is to create an AI-driven solution that helps policymakers and citizens understand pollution trends, take preventive measures, and work toward cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable cities.

# ✅ Week 1 : Project Setup & Exploration  

### 🧠 Objective  
To understand the **impact of pollution levels** across Indian cities and begin building a system that predicts the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using historical data.

### 📊 Tasks Completed  
- Researched real-time air-quality data sources (Kaggle – Air Quality Data in India).  
- Performed data cleaning and removed missing or null values.  
- Analyzed pollution trends by city and season.  
- Created initial visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  
- Set up GitHub repository for version control and weekly tracking.  

### 🧩 Key Learning  
- Data understanding & preprocessing fundamentals.  
- Importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) before modelling.

# ✅ Week 2 : Model Training & Improvisation  

### 🎯 Objective  
To develop and train a **Deep-Learning-based AQI Prediction Model** using Keras, and evaluate its performance on real data.

### 🧠 Tasks Completed  
- Loaded and cleaned the `city_day.csv` dataset.  
- Normalized features using `MinMaxScaler`.  
- Split data into training and testing sets.  
- Built a **Keras Sequential Model** with Dense layers.  
- Trained model to predict AQI values based on pollutant parameters.  
- Saved trained model in `.h5` format for future deployment.  
- Visualized prediction results and compared actual vs predicted values.  

### 💡 Improvisations Done  
- Improved data preprocessing and feature scaling.  
- Added deep-learning model (Keras Sequential).  
- Introduced clear visualizations for AQI trends.  
- Implemented model saving for integration with web/app interface.  
- Tested with random samples for accuracy validation.  

### 🧾 Results  
- Model trained successfully with **MAE ≈ 26 units**.  
- Predicted AQI values closely match real values on test samples.  
- Demonstrated model reliability for environmental monitoring.
