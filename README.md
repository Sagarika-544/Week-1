# Week-1
AI-based project that predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) in urban regions using Machine Learning. Analyzes historical air pollution and weather data to forecast AQI levels, supporting early warning systems and sustainable urban planning.
# 🌿 AI-Based Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Project Description
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in urban regions.  
By analyzing historical air pollution and weather data, the model forecasts future AQI levels to assist in early warning systems and sustainable urban planning.

The goal is to create an AI-driven solution that helps policymakers and citizens understand pollution trends, take preventive measures, and work toward cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable cities.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Uses real-world air quality and meteorological datasets.
- Implements multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Visualizes pollution patterns and influencing factors.
- Supports data-driven environmental and public health planning.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **OpenAQ / CPCB Datasets**
