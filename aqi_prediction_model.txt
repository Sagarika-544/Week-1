# 🌿 AI-Based Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Using Deep Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) across major Indian cities using historical pollution and meteorological data.  
The model applies deep learning techniques to provide accurate forecasts that support sustainable urban planning and early pollution control measures.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned missing and null values.
   - Normalized features using MinMaxScaler.
   - Selected key features: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Framework: TensorFlow / Keras.
   - Architecture: Sequential neural network with Dense layers.
   - Activation: ReLU and Linear for output.
   - Optimizer: Adam.
   - Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

3. **Model Performance:**
   - MAE ≈ 26.2
   - MSE ≈ 2314.8
   - The model demonstrates stable convergence and accurate AQI predictions across cities.

4. **Model Saving:**
   - Trained model saved as **`air_quality_model.h5`**.
   - Can be reused for API deployment or web dashboard integration.
